    As a Senior Software Engineer at KnockCRM, I bring years of experience in software development, UI engineering, and agile methodologies. Prior to my current role, I worked as a Software Engineer at Validity Inc, where I contributed to revamping an outdated product, DemandTools, by building and releasing an Electron application using Webpack, React, and Redux.
    <br />
    <br />
    Before my career in tech, I served as a Fireman in the United States Coast Guard, where I learned the importance of teamwork and effective communication.
    <br />
    <br />
    I hold a Bachelor's in Holistic Psychology from Lesley University and completed a Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly, specializing in JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Ember.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
    <br />
    <br />
    My expertise lies in JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML and CSS, and I have experience working on agile scrum teams, leading scrum ceremonies, contributing to reusable component libraries, and providing peer-to-peer code reviews.
